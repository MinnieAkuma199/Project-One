# Project-One

## Proposal - Team Wolfpack - Project 1

Project Title:  SCRATCH.COM - Your place to find puppy love!!

## Description: 

Every year about 6.3 Million Dogs are abandoned or given to shelters in the United States.  Of those, almost 1 million are euthanized due to not finding suitable homes.  Our goal with the SCRATCH.com app is to connect these fine furry friends with loving homes so both human and dog can live a happy long life of companionship.  The scratch.com app is a mobile focused, api driven pet finder that allows potential dog owners to view dogs up for adoption within their area, or an area of their choosing.  The user can then carousel through potential options, similar to a dating app, in order to find the right match and request a “date”.


## WireFrame:

User Story: Adopting and finding the right pet is tough.  As a user I want a resource to view multiple dogs up for adoption within my area or an area of my choosing as well as learn more about each dog including basic facts like age, sex, breed, fun facts.  I’d also like to be able to input my contact information in order to request a meeting.


## APIs to be Used: 

1.) RescueGroups.org - for pet and adoption information

2.) Mapbox Geolocations API - for location data
