# Scratch-App

## Initial Proposal - Team Wolfpack - Project 1

Project Title:  SCRATCH.COM - Your place to find puppy love!!

**Description:** 

Every year about 6.3 Million Dogs are abandoned or given to shelters in the United States.  Of those, almost 1 million are euthanized due to not finding suitable homes.  Our goal with the SCRATCH.com app is to connect these fine furry friends with loving homes so both human and dog can live a happy long life of companionship.  The scratch.com app is a mobile focused, api driven pet finder that allows potential dog owners to view dogs up for adoption within their area, or an area of their choosing.  The user can then carousel through potential options, similar to a dating app, in order to find the right match and request a “date”.


**WireFrame:**

User Story: Adopting and finding the right pet is tough.  As a user I want a resource to view multiple dogs up for adoption within my area or an area of my choosing as well as learn more about each dog including basic facts like age, sex, breed, fun facts.  I’d also like to be able to input my contact information in order to request a meeting.


**APIs to be Used:** 

1.) RescueGroups.org - for pet and adoption information

3.) Dog.Ceo - for pet images

2.) Mapbox Geolocations API - for location data


**Breakdown of Tasks:**

Repo Master - Kris

Design / Front End - Ellen

Technical Lead - Michael

Product Owner / PM - Peter


## Finalized App Functionality

Upon initializing the app, the user is presented with a location prompt. After confirming or denying location the user is then able to follow the on-screen instructions to 'boop', or click, the button displayed on the dog's nose. Clicking the button will initiate a modal to pop-up which will then ask the user to fill out their name, and information provided in the drop downs of what type of pet they are interested in looking up. After pressing the submit button on the modal, the user will be brought to the main page of the app. The user will see a carousel of potential dogs to choose from that displays an image of the dog, and a description with information about the selected dog. This information includes a pet description from the API, RescueGroups.org, the dog's breed, their age and activity level.

All API's listed in the proposal were used to the best of our ability but in future app development could be improved.
